Linux Presentations
===================

Goal
----

The goal of this repo is to create a set of linux presentation slides (~12)
that can be used at linux user group meetings. Ideally they will contain a set
of presenter notes and can be presented by anyone. The plan is to create them
using reStructuredText and then convert them to PDF.

Status
------

Currently in the planning phase. See the `issues page <https://github.com/oalug/presentations/issues>`_ to help.
